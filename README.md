"# Zenoti-Automator" 

A programming application that takes advantage of open APIs to create an appointment, select a guest, service, center, add a product, close and take payment, and leave a review. This is really important in keeping our demo environment updated so that our Sales/Solutions Engineers can present an effective demo. For context, this process was done manually before taking up to 3 hours a day. With this implementation, we have been able to reduce it to less than 5 minutes.
